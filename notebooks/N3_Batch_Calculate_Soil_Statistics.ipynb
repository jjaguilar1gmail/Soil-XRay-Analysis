    "**Summary:** In this Jupyter notebook, we calculate local and coarse statistics for all x-ray datasets and save them to a csv file for subsequent analysis and processing. These metrics include per-horizontal-slice calculations of **mean, median, standard deviation, 5th percentile and 95th percentile** of **sliding-window skewness, sliding-window kurtosis, sliding-window variance, sobel edges, pixel intensity and density**. Take a look at the load_process library (**get_stats** function in particular along with the functions it calls) along with previous notebooks for an overview of these calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we introduce the function that calculates these metrics, example usage, and an explanation for the choice of parameters used in a precomputed dataset that we use in later analyses. Then, we provide code compiling statistics for all horizontal slices in a scan as well by binned depths.\n"
